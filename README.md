# 6502-Emulator
## -> in progress

### What is the project about?
I'm trying emulate a 6502 microprocessor in C++, just to dig deeper into how computers really work. To make the emulator, I'll be following a [video series by '@Dave Poo' on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLwK93hM93Z13TRzPx9JqTIn33feefl37) This project is a part of my 'learning by doing' approach that I am using to learn C++.

### Progress Status
I've got all the LDA instructions sorted out; next up, I'm planning to impliment LDX and LDY.

### Why emulate a 6502?
Through this I am hoping to understand computers from a Low-Level point and also increase my familirity with C++. If all goes well, this project might branch out into a Nintendo NES emulator.
